## Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) basics
# MTA(s)
	* Unix/GNU Linux relied on SMTP
	  (simple mail transfer protocol that has default 
	  port of 25) for communications in-house
	* sendmail is MTA that is huge, old, and difficult 
	  to configure so very few systems use it as their 
	  default MTA
	* exim is MTA that is general and flexible with 
	  extensive facilities for checking incoming email
	  and has rich features with ACLs, authentication and 
	  so on
	* postfix is alternative MTA to sendmail and is 
	  much easier to configure.  postfix supports multiple 
	  domains, encryption.  Most current distros use 
	  postfix as default MTA
		* also should install mailx (or bsd-mailx) when 
		  installing postfix
# sendmail emulation layer
	* modern MTAs contain a sendmail emulation layer 
	  to try and comply with it to keep themselves 
	  backward compatible with sendmail
	* this allows modern MTAs to allow sendmail commands 
	  in place of installed MTAs essentially acting as 
	  sendmail
# aliases
	* /etc/aliases is where any existing aliases are stored 
	  and updated and also where new aliases are created
		* example: if email comes in for webmaster then 
		  this /etc/aliases file is referenced to confirm 
		  where/who the webmaster email should be 
		  received by
		* aliases file routes emails to correct recipient
# writing mail
	* $ mail
		* this command will list any emails for current user
	* $ mail <user>
		* this comment will start mail to user
		* enter Subject and hit enter
		* write the message and hit CTRL-D on an empty 
		  line
		* add user(s) to Cc: if needed and hit enter
		* done!
		* & q
			* this command will quit mail utility
# mailq
	* $ mailq
		* this command lists the mail queue
		* mail that has not yet been delivered
